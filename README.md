# Traffic-Data-Analysis-

My friends and I recently built a Road Accident Data Visualization Web App for Pune, and Iâ€™m super excited to share it here!

We gathered data from multiple sources, cleaned and organized it, and built a full web app to make exploring accident trends easy and insightful. From maps and charts to detailed filtering â€” itâ€™s all in there!

ðŸ”¹ What the app does:

Shows key accident stats & trends

Interactive heatmaps of accident hotspots

Filters by location, time, severity, cause

Time-based patterns by hour/day/month

Clean, responsive UI for any device

A big shoutout to Prof. Sunitra Dhotre Maâ€™am for guiding us through the process and supporting us at every step 

Built with React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and a lot of teamwork 

Itâ€™s been an awesome learning experience â€” if youâ€™d like to check it out or know more, feel free to ping me!
